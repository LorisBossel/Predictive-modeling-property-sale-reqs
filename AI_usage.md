## Use of Generative AI

Artificial intelligence was used at different stages of writing this report, while adopting a critical approach to the responses obtained.

DeepSeek-V3 ([https://chat.deepseek.com/](https://chat.deepseek.com/)) was used as a editorial and coder assistant. It is important to emphasize that its use remained strictly limited to improving existing content, without replacing personal reflection or original production.


## Main assigned taks

AI was primarily used to:
- Reformulate and correct certain initially written paragraphs
- Improve the clarity and fluidity of the report text
- Verify overall coherence and argumentative structure
- Assist with code syntax and debugging, help to respect the right programming techniques with **Python**.


## Examples of Typical questions Used

**For Writing:**
- "Here's an extract from my report: [text]. Can you correct the language errors and help me reword it to make it clearer?"
- "Is this explanation well placed and relevant, and therefore correctly formulated in the context of my project?"
- "How could I better structure this section on [subject]?"

**For Code Development:**
- "How to create grouped lag features in pandas?"
- "What is the best approach for temporal split in time series?"
- "Review this function for potential bugs or improvements"
- "How I can use pylint to improve my code quality?"

**For Technical Clarification:**
- "Explain why cyclical encoding (sin/cos) is better than integer encoding for months"
- "How the ARIMA ML model works?"
- "What are hyperparameters for Random Forest?"

## Critical Approach

The responses provided were analyzed, adjusted, and integrated in a thoughtful manner. No passage was used as-is without personal modification.

**Key Principles:**
- All AI suggestions were reviewed and validated by the author
- Code was written or substantially modified with full understanding
- All analytical work and conclusions are 100% original
- AI served as an assistant, not a content generator
